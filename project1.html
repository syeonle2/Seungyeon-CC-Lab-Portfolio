    <h1>Critical Computation Lab Assignment 01 | Lost and Found</h1>
    <h2>This is my project for 'Lost and Found' project.</h2>
    <p1>This project was about drawing an object that my friend lost.<br>
        My friend's object was her key for her house. <br>
        The description that I received from her was: <br>
        A blue circle key with a samller white circle in the middle.<br>
        The size of it is slightly bigger than the 1 cent coin.<br>
        <br>
        Below is the sketch that I made based on the description.
