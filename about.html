    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello, I'm Seungyeon Lee. I'm a Graphic designer currently studying at Parsons.<br>
        I have a professional experience in publication design, and now I'm exploring a new field of game design in Parsons.<br>
        I love making and playing games, especially the story-heavy games and survival games. <br>
        I am a person who loves experiments and challenges, and have strong illustration and plot building skills.<br>
        When I'm not designing, you'll probably find me hiking and doing escape rooms somewhere in New York.
    </p>
