    <h1>Critical Computation Lab Assignment 07 | Autobiographical Game</h1>
    <h2>This is my project for 'Autobiographical Game' project.</h2>
    <p1>This project was about making a game that can represent myself.<br>
        I made a face full of bubbles that changes colors of bubbles and can interact with moving your mouse. <br>
        'Unusual Patissier' is a game about a bunny who wants to join her friend's party but can't afford to buy her a present. <br>
        They have been friends since they were babies, so they know each other really well and love each other a lot. <br>
        Their friendship is still ongoing, but it has been so long since they've met each other because of their schoolwork and other things. <br>
        Their lives have been so busy, as we all do when we grow up.<br>
        <br>
        This game is about what the true friendship is. <br>
        Even though the bunny didn't buy the friend a gift, the friend still feels happy because she could see her love in the cake by seeing lots of carrots in the cake, which is her favorite vegetable.<br> 
        When we feel other people's love, it's not about the money they spend for you, the important thing is how much they care about you. <br>
        This is what I feel about friendship and what I always feel about other's gifts. <br>
        <br>
        Below is the game 'Unusual Patissier'. Hope you'll enjoy it!
