    <h1>Critical Computation Lab Assignment 04 | Exquisite Corpse</h1>
    <h2>This is my project for 'Exquisite Corpse' project.</h2>
    <p1>This project was about drawing an exquisite figure combining other body parts of your teammates.<br>
        I made a exquisite corpse using my teammates sketches, and added where people can interact with their mouse. <br>
        Her eyes will follow where you are going and also, please take some pictures of her. I can't tell if she's going to like it, but let's try!<br>
        <br>
        Below is the sketch of my collaborative exquisite corpse that you can startle with clicking her!<br>
